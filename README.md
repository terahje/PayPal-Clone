# PayPal-Clone

## Description

This project goes through the process of making a site like PayPal. It was interesting how to use Js to implement a hover effect for the navigation. It also utilizes Js to navigate from the single page to the login and signup page. It took more work to make responsive than the other projects, but the process is much easier with how flexbox is utilized throughout the project.
